               <p> Quentin Jerome Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, <br>
 screenwriter, producer, and actor. His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, aestheticization <br>
 of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture and a wide variety <br>
 of other films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, <br>
 and features of neo-noir film.</p>

  <p>He began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, a crime thriller film which was <br>
funded by money from the sale of his screenplay True Romance (1993). Empire magazine hailed Reservoir Dogs as the "Greatest <br>
Independent Film of All Time". His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a crime comedy, was a major success both among critics and <br>
audiences.He also wrote the screenplay for the horror comedy film From Dusk till Dawn (1996),in which he also starred. <br>
Tarantino paid homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie Brown (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel <br> 
Rum Punch.</p>

   <p>In 2003, Tarantino delivered Kill Bill: Volume 1, a highly stylized "revenge flick" in the cinematic traditions of kung fu films <br>
and Japanese martial arts; Volume 2 followed in 2004. Tarantino next directed the exploitation slasher film Death Proof (2007), <br>
part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez released in the tradition of 1970s grindhouse cinema, under the collective title <br>
Grindhouse. His long-postponed Inglourious Basterds (2009) tells an alternate history of Allied forces in Nazi Germany, and was  <br>
released to critical acclaim. He followed that with another critical success, Django Unchained (2012), a Spaghetti Western set in <br>
the Antebellum South. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a long-form Western initially screened in a 70 mm roadshow <br>
theatrical release. His ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), recounts an alternate history of events surrounding the <br>
 Tateâ€“LaBianca murders.</p>

   <p>Tarantino's films have garnered both critical and commercial success as well as a dedicated cult-following. He has received many <br>
 industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards[5] and the Palme d'Or, and has been <br>
nominated for an Emmy and five Grammys. In 2005, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in <br>
the world. Filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him "the single most influential director of his generation". <br>
In December 2015, Tarantino received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry.</p>
